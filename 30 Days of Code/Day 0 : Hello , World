Here we have to simply take input from user and print Hello , World and on the next line print the user input.

CODE : 

# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print(input_string)
