This is a basic problem on Data Types. Here we have to input 3 values of data types int, double and string.

CODE: 

i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.

a=int(input())
b=float(input())
c=input()

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i+a)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d+b)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first
print(s+c)
