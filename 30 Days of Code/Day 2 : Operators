In this challenge, we will work with arithmetic operators. 

CODE:

# Complete the solve function below.
def solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent):
    tip=(meal_cost*tip_percent)/100
    tax=(meal_cost*tax_percent)/100
    total=int(round((meal_cost+tip+tax)))
    print(total)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    meal_cost = float(input())

    tip_percent = int(input())

    tax_percent = int(input())
    
    solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent)
